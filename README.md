## RPI Supplementary Materials

Paleocoordinates.r is used to create the approximate ages and paleocoordinates found within the database.

LongLat.r is used to run all of the analyses. 

Within LongLat.r, the rds analysis must me run and saved before being able to read in the file (too big to upload here).
